```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Jyotir-1924/loan-explorer>
cd loan-explorer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 4. Initialize the Database
```bash
npm install -D tsx
npm run seed
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Badge Logic

Each loan product card displays up to **3 dynamic badges** based on its features.

### Badge Conditions

| Badge | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| **Low APR** | `rate_apr < 10` |
| **No Prepayment Fee** | `prepayment_allowed === true` |
| **Fast Disbursal** | `disbursal_speed === "fast"` |
| **Low Docs** | `docs_level === "low"` |
| **Flexible Tenure** | `tenure_max_months >= 84` |
| **Low Processing Fee** | `processing_fee_pct <= 1` |
| **Salary Eligible** | `min_income <= 300000` |
| **Low Credit Score** | `min_credit_score <= 700` |

### Rules

- Badges are evaluated in priority order
- Only top 3 badges are shown per product
- Keeps the UI clean and readable

## AI Grounding Strategy

The AI chat is **strictly grounded** to a single loan product to prevent incorrect or hallucinated responses.

### How It Works

1. User asks a question about a loan product
2. Server fetches product data from the database
3. A controlled prompt is built using:
   - Product details
   - FAQs
   - Conversation history
4. AI is instructed to:
   - Use only provided product data
   - Politely decline unrelated questions
5. The response is returned and saved

### Grounding Rules

- No external knowledge is allowed
- One product per conversation
- Out-of-scope questions are politely refused
- All amounts are formatted in Indian Rupees (₹)

### Example

**User:** "Compare this with SBI loans"

**AI:** "I can only answer questions about this specific loan product."
